# The Wired

The Wired is more than just another platform; it's a pathway to the open metaverse.

self-sovereign identity, and seamless interoperability.

## Motivation

Today's VR ecosystem is fragmented by proprietary platforms that confine users and developers to isolated, controlled environments.
Each platform enforces its own set of rules and restrictions, often under leadership
that makes arbitrary decisions with no recourse for the people who live within these virtual worlds.

With VR our digital rights matter more than ever.
The Wired acknowledges this importance by ensuring that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a few.
Instead, it fosters a decentralized environment where everyone can contribute and shape the future of 3D content.

By embracing open source principles, The Wired doesn't just safeguard against abuse;
it unleashes a wave of creativity and collaboration.
Anyone can innovate, experiment, and enhance the ecosystem, driving progress for all.
