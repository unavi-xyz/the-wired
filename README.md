# The Wired Protocol

The Wired Protocol is an open and extensible protocol for creating, hosting, and interacting with 3D virtual worlds.
This repository contains JSON schemas for the protocol.

The protocol is currently in an early stage of development, and is subject to change.
We welcome any feedback and contributions.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind the Wired Protocol is to enable a decentralized and interoperable metaverse, where anyone can create, host, and share 3D virtual worlds.
By providing a standard schema for world metadata, the Wired Protocol aims to facilitate the discovery, access, and interaction of diverse virtual worlds across various platforms and applications.

## Design Goals

The main design goals of the Wired Protocol are:

1. **Openness**: The schema is designed to be open and extensible, allowing for custom extensions and modifications to suit specific use cases.
2. **Interoperability**: The schema aims to promote interoperability between different platforms, applications, and virtual worlds in the metaverse.
3. **Decentralization**: The Wired Protocol encourages a decentralized approach to hosting and sharing virtual worlds, similar to the World Wide Web.
4. **Ease of Use**: The schema is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it accessible to creators, developers, and users alike.
