# The Wired Protocol

The Wired Protocol is an open and extendable protocol for creating, hosting, and interacting with 3D virtual worlds.
This repository contains JSON schemas for the protocol.

The protocol is currently in an early stage of development, and is subject to change. Any feedback or contributions are appreciated.

## Motivation

Openness and extendability are key to creativity and innovation - just look at how mods have transformed the gaming industry, giving rise to entirely new genres of games - but current social platforms, especially 3D platforms, are lacking in this aspect. Platforms today are closed off and proprietary. They are controlled by a single company, and users are locked into a single version of a platform without the ability to customize their experience or experiment with mods. There is certainly tons of awesome creative work being done by communities and individuals pushing the limits of platforms like VRChat, Neos, Roblox - but it can only go so far. The servers are owned by the platform, the code is closed source, and ultimately the platform is profiting off the work of the community for free (or in the case of Roblox, you get a [24.5% share](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/economics) of the content you sell, lol).

As we spend more and more time in virtual spaces, especially when in VR, it is important that we have freedom within the spaces we inhabit and the avatars we embody. The Wired is an attempt to create a protocol that allows for this freedom. It is no silver bullet, but by building a platform that is open source, extendable, and decentralized, we hope to create a space that is truly owned by the community - a space that can be experimented with, pushed to its limits, and ultimately transformed into something we can't even imagine today.

## Design Goals

- **Openness**: The protocol is designed to be open. Anyone can create their own client or server, and users can choose which client to use and which server to connect to.
- **Extendability**: The protocol is designed to be easily extendable. Anyone can extend the protocol and add new features.
- **Decentralization**: The protocol is designed to be decentralized. There is no central authority - it's like the web, but for 3D worlds.
