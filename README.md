# The Wired

The VR landscape today is comprised of closed off platforms (VRChat, Neos, ChilloutVR, Horizon Worlds),
built within the traditional framework of app stores and isolated experiences.
Each app is a walled garden with it's own friends list, file formats, and (sometimes questionable) leadership.

But this approach goes against the fundamentally social nature of VR - the human aspect that makes it such a special medium!

With VR our digital identity and how we are represented is more important than ever.
We should not lose access to our friends or avatars just to experience an app.
Additionally, no single company should have the power to control our identity or social connections - it's too important to
leave up to good faith.

The Wired is an attempt to change this status quo by providing an alternative framework for building, publishing,
and experiencing content in a standardized and interoperable format - or more simply, to bring the success of the Web to 3D.
