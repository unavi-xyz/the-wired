# The Wired

The Wired is an open protocol for creating interoperable 3D apps.

## ü§î Motivation

The VR landscape today is comprised of closed off platforms built within the traditional "walled garden" framework of app stores and isolated experiences.
Each app has it's own friends list, avatars, file formats, and (sometimes questionable) leadership.
Mods get banned, users get banned, and everyone who lives within these spaces get no say in the matter.

But this approach goes against the fundamentally social nature of VR - the human aspect that makes it such a special medium!

With VR our digital identity is more important than ever.
We embody our virtual avatars, we form real human connections with other people.
This happens all across the internet - but with VR it becomes much more real.
No single company should have absolute power over our experience - it's too important to
leave up to good faith (and even with good intentions these systems fail, innocent people get banned).

The Wired is an attempt to change this status quo by providing an alternative framework for building, publishing,
and experiencing content in a standardized and interoperable format - or put more simply, to bring the success of the Web to 3D.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Goals

- **Openness** - The protocol should remain entirely open, much like the Web.
You do not need permission to create or host content.

- **Extensibility** - The protocol should be easily extendable,
allowing developers to build upon the core functionality with new features.

- **Backwards compatibility** - Ensuring content built within The Wired continues to work into the future
is a vital part of developing a rich ecosystem.
